# Network-optimization-using-Karger-s-algorithms

Given an undirected and unweighted graph, find the smallest cut (smallest number of edges that disconnects the graph into two components). The input graph may have parallel edges. This problem is called the minimum cut problem. The two main algorithms used to solve this problem are the Max-flow based min-cut algorithm and Kargerâ€™s algorithm for a minimum cut. This project provides an implementation of Karger's algorithm and its more efficient version, the Karger-Stein algorithm in Python.
